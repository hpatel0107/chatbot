This repository contains the source code and implementation for an Attendance Chat Bot project powered by Natural Language Processing (NLP). The aim of this project is to develop a chat bot that automates the attendance tracking process through intelligent conversation.
#Features
•	Conversational Interface: The chat bot provides a user-friendly conversational interface where users can interact using natural language.
•	Attendance Tracking: The bot effectively manages attendance for various scenarios like classes, meetings, or events. It can handle multiple sessions, different time zones, and exceptions.
•	Natural Language Processing: Leveraging NLP techniques, the bot can understand and interpret attendance-related queries and commands expressed in different formats and variations.
•	User Authentication: The bot ensures authorized access to attendance data and administrative tasks through user authentication.
•	Analytics and Reporting: The bot generates attendance reports, statistics, and insights based on collected data, providing valuable analytics for attendance management.
•	Integration: The bot seamlessly integrates with other systems and platforms, such as Learning Management Systems (LMS), calendars, or communication tools, for enhanced functionality and interoperability.

#Technologies Used
•	Python: The project is primarily developed using Python programming language.
•	Natural Language Processing Libraries: NLP libraries such as NLTK or spaCy are utilized for tasks like text tokenization, lemmatization, and intent recognition.
•	Neural Network: The attendance chat bot model is implemented using a neural network, specifically with the TensorFlow framework.
•	Data Persistence: Attendance data is stored and managed efficiently using a database system like PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB.
•	Web Development: Web development technologies like Flask or Django may be utilized for creating a web-based user interface for the chat bot.
